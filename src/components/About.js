            Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a Senior Web Developer, and I've been building web applications for over five years now. I really love creating cool stuff online. I'm especially passionate about using React and Three.js to make websites that are fast, look amazing, and really grab your attention. I've built everything from those quick, simple single-page applications, all the way to super interactive 3D web experiences that really push the boundaries. Three.js is my go-to for creating stunning visuals and letting people interact with websites in really unique ways.
